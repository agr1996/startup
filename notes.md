# Notes For Class

## For Practice
I am adding this to see if I can commit from my other computer that I just installed git bash and visual studio code on

## Commiting to github
It is important to commit and push often to avoid conflicts, because merging conflicts is a little messy but md is pretty powerful for the style of a notes section.
## HTML Structure Tags
Some good tags to keep tract of are body, header, footer, main, sections, aside, p, ol/ul, div span etc. good to add more
Lots of tags can be sandwiched to change the style of text within a text insert box. Buttons can be replaced with an SVG and you can put requirements on text insert tags
